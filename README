This is SimpleJMX, an Apache-licensed very simple library to expose
your classes as JMX MBeans.

As the JSR-255 (aka JMX 2.0) seems to be postponed indefinitely, I just needed
a simple library that could automate the most important usecases for JMX. In
addition, it needed to be under a permissive license. There are some wonderful
libraries out there already, but they're mostly licensed under LGPL.  So
here's one more, but with Apache license this time.

USAGE
=====

MBeanBuilder is the main class for all these things.  To register

MBeanBuilder.register( myobject );

to unregister

MBeanBuilder.unregister( myobject );

Annotations:

@MBean(name="...", description="")

* name = JMX ObjectName.  For example "com.ecyrd.mypackage:name=FooBar" creates an object called
  "FooBar" under hierarchy tree 'com.ecyrd.mypackage".
  
* description = JMX Description for this name

@ManagedAttribute(description="")

May be set for setters or getters (either in the form of "isXXX" or "getXXX"). The corresponding
getter or setter must follow the same naming convention.  Currently fields cannot be annotated;
you need to have a getter.

@ManagedOperation(description="")

Set to make this method available for JMX calls.  Current limitation is that you cannot use
overloaded methods (i.e. all managed operations must have a different method name).
